  # Suggestion:                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                
    You can use the `smtplib` library in Python to send an email. Here's an example function that takes user    
  input and sends it to an email address:                                                                       
                                                                                                                
    ```python

        message = f'Subject: User Input\n\n{user_input}'                                                        
                                                                                                                
        with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:                                                     
            server.starttls()

  Make sure to replace `'your_email@example.com'` with your own email address and `'your_password'` with your   
  email password. Also, you'll need to enable "less secure apps" access in your email account settings to allow 
  Python to send emails.
